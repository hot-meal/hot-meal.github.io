      <description>The most valuable strategy for communication is the simplest: clarity.
When you communicate with clarity, people spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying.
As a result, they’ll understand you faster, and with less effort.
It helps to be a user-centered, or reader-centered.
Think about what your readers might already know The thing you wish to communicate, already makes sense to you, because you’re immersed in it. But you should never assume that people reading your work will have the same knowledge.</description>
