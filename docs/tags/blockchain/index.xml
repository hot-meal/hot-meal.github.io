      <description>web1 was a decentralised internet. People would host their own websites and emails on their own servers at home.
Later we began instead choosing to publish content on centralised platforms like myspace, facebook, reddit, instagram and to entrust email to Hotmail and gmail. This is web2.
The basic premise of web3 is to make everything decentralised once again.
Since the average person does not want to run their own servers, we should build systems that can distribute trust without having to distribute the infrastructure.</description>
