      <description>The purpose of a headline is to get your audience to read the second line.
The art of writing a great headline can be broken down into a formula:
Great Headline = End Result User Wants + Specific Period Of Time + Address The Objections
The key is to tell the user in seconds what your communication or product will actually do for them, not what it is.
This also encourages the headline writer to think about the customer, and not about their product.</description>
