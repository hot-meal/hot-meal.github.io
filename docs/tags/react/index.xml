      <description>Any veteran of the JavaScript framework landscape would probably agree that the idea of hooks as a superior paradigm as being a little ridiculous.
If a linter is required to inform you when you&amp;rsquo;re writing a bug, one that is not immediately obvious, then this is a failing in the framework to round those sharp edges.
Lints are not rounded edges!
The simplicity that comes with hooks is a trade-off of complexity that is now completely out of sight, and only appears once the code is run in a linter.</description>
