      <title>The Art of the Headline</title>

      <description>The purpose of a headline is to get your audience to read the second line.
The art of writing a great headline can be broken down into a formula:
Great Headline = End Result User Wants + Specific Period Of Time + Address The Objections
The key is to tell the user in seconds what your communication or product will actually do for them, not what it is.
This also encourages the headline writer to think about the customer, and not about their product.</description>

      <description>The most valuable strategy for communication is the simplest: clarity.
When you communicate with clarity, people spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying.
As a result, they’ll understand you faster, and with less effort.
It helps to be a user-centered, or reader-centered.
Think about what your readers might already know The thing you wish to communicate, already makes sense to you, because you’re immersed in it. But you should never assume that people reading your work will have the same knowledge.</description>
