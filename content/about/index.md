I'm a web developer, technical consultant and writer with over 15 years experience.

I enjoy mentoring developers, optimising processes, and finding pragmatic solutions to engineering problems.

On the front-end I'm proficient with:
- javascript, node, react 
- html, css, sass

On the back-end:
- python, php, bash automation, cli

I'm also interested in film, music and non-fiction literature.
