It can seem sometimes, that we have a lot of time.

We might feel like we're wasting it, like we should be using this time productively, to better ourselves, to do something more meaningful. 

But are we just burdening ourselves with needless guilt. 

Our anxieties can make it seem like there are so many things to learn, so many things to experience, so many unexplored possibilities, we fear on missing out, chasing something, <mark>but what exactly we don't really know...</mark>

But maybe you don't need to feel this way. 

Perhaps most of us are fine exactly where we are. 

This notion that you need to make the most out of every moment, often perpetuated by self-help and productivity gurus; live life to the fullest, see all the places, chase the uncomfortable!  

I don't think it's necessarily the best advice, the happiest most contented people sometimes are the ones with very simple, boring routines.
