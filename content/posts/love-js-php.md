{{< blockquote author="Bjarne Stroustrup (Inventor of C++)" >}}
There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.
{{< /blockquote >}}

I've used many languages in my career, Classic ASP to Python, from .Net to Ruby.

Yet, I still keep coming back to PHP and Javascript.

I've find that PHP and Javascript are <mark>used by people who get shit done</mark>.

- They are pragmatic 
- They understand business needs
- They can scaffold and iterate quickly
- They have launched and maintained many projects of all levels of quality
  
There has been no shortage of cargo-culting in Web Development. So it bears saying, PHP8 is not PHP3, ECMAScript 12 is not 2010s Javascript.

Javascript particularly has been a true hotbed of innovation for years.

Although, they may not popular for their elegance, they have seem real practical benefits:
- Speed & ease of deployment
- Large choice of Tooling
- Large choice of frameworks
- Many platforms and runtime environments
  

PHP, because of its cgi-bin model also has many benefits:
- Fairly easy to refactor legacy codebases in increments
- Resource leaks are almost non-existent
- Caching and scaling are a lot easier to manage
  
These languages also have a level of immediacy. There is pleasure in finding ways to write elegant code in a language that doesn't prescribe any.

They are very flexibile and permissive, allowing people of different skill levels to get going with programming. You can be a complete beginner with PHP and get a website going within a few hours.

I believe writing good software is much more than the choice of language:

- Having good naming and design conventions and patterns
- Enforcing invariants with static analysis or unit testing
- Providing effective and rapid feedback loops to developers
- Strong team communication
  
Choice of language doesn't have much bearing on any of these.
