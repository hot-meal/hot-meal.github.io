{{< blockquote author="Bjarne Stroustrup (Inventor of C++)" >}}
There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.
{{< /blockquote >}}

Over the last fifteen years, I've used over a dozen languages, from Classic ASP to Python, from .Net to Ruby.

Yet, I still keep coming back to PHP and Javascript.

I've found over my career that PHP and Javascript are primarily <mark>used by people who get shit done</mark>.

- They are pragmatic and understand and prioritise business needs
- They can scaffold and iterate quickly
- They have launched and maintained many projects of all levels of quality
  
There has been no shortage of cargo-culting throughout the years. Particularly in Web Development. How many trees have been burnt on React alone?

So it bears saying, PHP8 is not PHP3, ECMAScript 12 is not 2010s Javascript.

These ecosystems have progressed a lot over the years.

They have also put a lot of development pressure on other languages. With its almost daily new paradigms and frameworks, Javascript has been a true hotbed of innovation (and frustration, for some) for years.

These languages may not popular for their simple elegance, but for other more practical reasons:
- Speed & ease of deployment
- Large choice of Tooling
- Large choice of frameworks
- Many platforms and runtime environments
  

PHP, because of its cgi-bin model also has many benefits:
- Fairly easy to refactor legacy codebases in increments
- Resource leaks are almost non-existent
- Caching and scaling are a lot easier to manage
  
These languages are also fun. They have a level of immediacy. There is some pleasure to be had finding ways to write elegant code in a language that doesn't prescribe any.

As these languages are very flexibile and permissive, they also allow people of all different skill levels and backgrounds to get going with programming. You can be a complete beginner with PHP and get a real website going within a day.

Over the years, I have found that writing good software is much more than the choice of language:

- Having good naming and design patterns
- Enforcing invariants with static analysis or unit testing
- Providing effective and rapid feedback loops to developers
- Having strong team communication
  
None of these depend on the choice of language.
