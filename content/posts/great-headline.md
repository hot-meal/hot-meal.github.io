The purpose of a headline is to get your audience to read the second line.

The art of writing a great headline can be broken down into a formula:

Great Headline = End Result User Wants + Specific Period Of Time + Address The Objections

The key is to tell the user in seconds what your communication or product will actually <mark>do for them, not what it is</mark>. 

This also encourages the headline writer to think about the customer, and not about their product.

Some examples of this formula in action:

- Hot fresh pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or its free 
- Your home sold in 90 days or I'll buy it


Always be clear, not clever. Clarity always beats persuasion.

You should write to the individual, as if you're talking to a single person. Don’t write to the masses.

And always remember, it’s not about your message. It’s about what your user wants.
