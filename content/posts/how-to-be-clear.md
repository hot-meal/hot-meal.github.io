The most valuable strategy for communication is the simplest: clarity.

When you communicate with clarity, people spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying. 

As a result, they’ll understand you faster, and with less effort.

It helps to be a user-centered, or reader-centered.

### Think about what your readers might already know

The thing you wish to communicate, already makes sense to you, because you’re immersed in it. But you should never assume that people reading your work will have the same knowledge. 

They might have a different mental model. They might have the same model, but they may see things differently. Or they might have no mental model at all, 

Every time you write something or create something that communicates about your work, you need to consider these varying mental models. 

Just as good web content is written for a reading age of 9, you will probably need to simplify your communication for most people, to make it as accessible as possible.

Try to see your work from their point of view, and write to accommodate that.

### Prefer shorter sentences, with simpler words

Writing with clarity doesn’t come easily, it takes practice.

It’s difficult to make something complicated simple. We might try to add lots of caveats and edge-cases. 

The end result is often longer sentences with plenty of commas and clauses. Which is hard to read.


### Think about your audience

Good communication happens when you spend more time thinking about your audience. 

Before starting any new piece of communication work, I ask: “What’s the purpose? What’s the point?”

Start by thinking about what you want your audience to understand, know, or do after they’ve seen a piece of communication. Knowing that helps you see the end result more clearly, sooner. 

It helps you avoid going down the wrong path, and focus the content of the comms on that goal, for that audience. If you can’t identify and clearly express the purpose up front, stop working on it and find out why the purpose is so muddy. 

Think about your audiences. Communicate often, in short bursts, about one thing at a time. 

Make sure there’s a reason for each new piece of communication to exist. Say what you mean. Be as clear as you can be. Your team will be more successful as a result.
