When you communicate with clarity, people spend less time trying to interpret what you’re saying. 

As a result, they’ll understand you faster, and with less effort.

It helps to be a user-centered, or reader-centered.

### Think about what your readers might already know

The thing you wish to communicate, already makes sense to you, because you’re immersed in it. But you should never assume that people reading your work will have the same knowledge. 

Just as good web content is written for a reading age of 9, you will probably need to simplify your communication for most people, to make it as accessible as possible.

Try to see your work from their point of view, and write to accommodate that.
