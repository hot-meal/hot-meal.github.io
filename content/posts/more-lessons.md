Innovation is not always linear. Many times you need to make something worse before you can make it better.

When you replace an old legacy system, you need to do it incrementally. step-by-step, otherwise it can be too much risk for stakeholders to support fully. This means you won’t actually see the benefits of *replacing* something until the end. <mark>When you’re *adding* new things, you're also likely regressing.</mark> So manage expectations.

It's good to let users try a new thing one piece at a time. Even if you want them to use it everywhere, You should make that seem to be *their* idea.

When you’re trying to introduce a new workflow (eg different task tracking tool) to the team, it’s up to you to try and get people onboard with it and try it out (“i know you prefer keeping tasks in an xsl, let me synchronise that document for you for a while and we’ll see how it goes?”).

If your technical vision is sound, in theory, and you slowly chip away at the problem with patience and perseverance, organisational support, pragmatic compromises, and optimism, eventually the theory will win.
