If you’re junior developer, you will probably assume that every word from the senior developers is a pearl of wisdom.  In many cases they will be, if you’re lucky.

But unfortunately  not all senior developers are created (or promoted) equal.

For every company with knowledgeable, helpful senior developers exists another populated by small people with small minds, whose main qualification isn’t technical ability, but hanging around for a long time, managing not to get fired, and stumbling into promotions with titles like “senior” or “principal.”

So when you’re new, be sure to give the seniors the benefit of the doubt and defer to them, but don’t assume that what they tell you is true, correct or right.  Try to always verify it on your own (just preferably not right in front of them!).
