{{< blockquote author="Steve Jobs" >}}
When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world...

Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it
{{< /blockquote >}}

I believe you should take every opportunity in life, and work to question assumptions and approaches that are <mark>“this is the way things have always been done”</mark>. 

If you have a new team member joining, pay attention to where they get confused and what questions they ask. 

If you get a feature request that doesn’t make sense? Try to understand the goal and what is driving the desire for this functionality. 

If you don’t get a clear answer, keep asking why until you understand.
