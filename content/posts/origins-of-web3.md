To understand web3 it helps to briefly review what is meant by web1 and web2.

web1 was a decentralised internet. People would host their own websites and emails on their own servers at home.

Over time, things started to become more centralised. 

People began instead choosing to publish their content on centralised platforms like myspace, facebook, reddit, instagram and so forth and to entrust their email to the likes of Hotmail and gmail. This is web2.

## What is web3?

The basic premise of web3 is to make everything decentralised once again.

The protocols that underly the internet, such as email, http, tcp/ip and so on, move much more slowly than a decentralised platform can. 

For example, after half a century, email is still not encrypted; whereas WhatsApp went from unencrypted to encrypted in a year. 

This is a problem, since the rest of the ecosystem is moving very quickly, if you don’t keep up you will fail. 


## An ideal web3

Since the average person does not want to run their own servers, we should build systems that can distribute trust without having to distribute the infrastructure. 

This means the architecture should anticipate the inevitablility of centralised client/server relationships, while using cryptography (rather than infrastructure) to distribute the trust. 

One of the most surprising things about the current state of web3, is that despite being built on “crypto,” there is actually very little cryptography involved.

We should also try to reduce the burden of building software. 

As long as writing software requires so much energy and focus, it will tend to serve the interests of the people making it rather than what we may consider our broader goals. 

Changing our relationship to technology requires making software easier to create, in my lifetime I’ve seen the opposite come to pass. 

Unfortunately, I believe distributed systems have a tendency to exacerbate this trend by making things more complicated and more difficult, not less complicated and less difficult.
