Test Driven Development (TDD) was a real game-changer for me.

When it comes to programming, or anything tech-related, we, as an industry, generally go pretty nuts with our biases.

- IDE vs text editor?
- MacOS, Windows, or Linux?
- What do you think of PHP?
- Tabs or spaces?

If you bring any of these up in a discussion, you will observe terminally stupid shouting matches occur between those with strong opinions. 

So with this in mind, I accept that I’m wading into somewhat similar territory here with to TDD or not to TDD.

I don't intend to preach, but hopefully rather to share my own experiences.

Around 8 years ago or so, I was pretty much a skeptic of TDD. Not a unit testing skeptic, mind you, as I’d accepted that as a useful practice more orless the get-go.

As for TDD?  Well, I wasn’t so sure about that.

My first experience with TDD, I had spent about 4-5 hours writing some code without actually running it to see if my changes were working. Usually I would run the code every 10 minutes or so to check to see if my changes were actually working.

Upon realising that I was already hours into coding, I fired up the UI, with an exhausted sigh, expecting hours of debugging ahead.  After all, I had procrastinated by something like 20 cycles.

But then a strange and magical thing happened.  Everything just worked.

It all just worked perfectly, first time, without exception.  There were absolutely no surprises whatsoever.  I had been writing code for hours without even looking at my own UI or validating anything at buildtime, and it all just worked.

Since then, I'v learned the technique, and mastered it, consulted on it, and did developer coaching on it.  But even beyond that, I have monitored the effects of unit testing on codebases and found those effects to be undoubtedly good.

Learn TDD.  I promise you won’t regret it.
