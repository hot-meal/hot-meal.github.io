My first experience with TDD, I had spent about 2-3 hours writing some code without actually running it to see if my changes were working. Usually I would run the code every 10 minutes or so to check to see if my changes were actually working.

Upon realising that I was already hours into coding, I fired up the UI, with a sigh, expecting some intense debugging ahead. 

But then a strange thing happened. Everything just worked.

Since then, I'v learned the technique, and mastered it.  But beyond that, I have monitored the effects of unit testing on codebases and found those effects to be undoubtedly good.
