Test Driven Development (TDD) can be a real game-changer.

When it comes to programming, we, as an industry, generally go pretty extreme with our biases.

- IDE vs text editor?
- MacOS, Windows, or Linux?
- What do you think of PHP?
- Tabs or spaces?

If you bring any of these up in a discussion, you will observe terminally stupid shouting matches occur between those with strong opinions. 

So with that in mind, I accept that I’m wading into somewhat similar area here with to TDD or not to TDD.

Around 8 years ago or so, I was pretty much a skeptic of TDD. Not a unit testing skeptic, as I’d accepted that as a useful practice more or less from the get-go.

As for TDD?  I wasn’t so sure about that.

My first experience with TDD, I had spent about 2-3 hours writing some code without actually running it to see if my changes were working. Usually I would run the code every 10 minutes or so to check to see if my changes were actually working.

Upon realising that I was already hours into coding, I fired up the UI, with a sigh, expecting some intense debugging ahead. 

But then a strange thing happened. Everything just worked.

It all just worked perfectly, first time, without exception. Absolutely no surprises.  I had been writing code for hours without even looking at my own UI, and it all just worked.

Since then, I'v learned the technique, and mastered it, consulted on it, and did coaching on it.  But beyond that, I have monitored the effects of unit testing on codebases and found those effects to be undoubtedly good.

Learn TDD.  I promise you won’t regret it.
