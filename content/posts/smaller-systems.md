There are many things that can push you towards building a bigger, more complex system, up-front. 

Such as budget allocation, an inability to decide which features to cut, or a desire to deliver the “best version” of a system. 

These things all push us towards building too much. You should always fight this. 

We <mark>learn so much as we're building a system</mark> that we end up iterating into a much better system than we ever would have designed in the first place. 

This is quite a hard sell to most people.
